## If statement
```bash
if [ $var -eq 200 ]
then
	echo something
else
	echo another thing
fi
```
- `if` syntax, if then a bracket (the bracket must have space)
- `then` after the if statement
- `else` will be evaluated if condition is not true
- need to end it with `fi`
- `-eq` mean equal to, equivalent to `==` in python
```bash
if [ ! $var -eq 200 ]
```
- putting `!` before the variable reverse then logic, similar to `if var != 200:`
Everything in the bracket is test statement
- in test, if the condition is met, it returns 0, else returns 1; similar to `True` and `False` in python

**Integer Logic Test**
 - `-eq` is equal to
 - `-ne` not equal to
 - `-gt` `-lt` greater or less than
 - `-le` `ge` greater, less or equal
`=` and `!=` also works for integers, but need to have space between 2 integers `[ 10 = 10]`

**String/File Logic Test**
https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Bash_Test_Operators.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index
- `=` or `!=` is equal or not
 - `-f` if the file is normal
 - `-d` if directory exist
 - `-r/w/w` if a file has read, write, execute
 - `-z` if a variable is empty
 - `-n` is a variable is nonempty
### Command Chaining
`;` semi-colon, all command after will run regardless of exit status
`&&` double ampersand, all commands after will only run if previous command is successful
- in the context of `if` statements, both have to be true for it to run
`||` OR operator, command after it will run only if the command before it failed
- this is why `[ 1 = 2 ] || echo failed` will print out `failed`, since the test `[]` result in exit code of `1` due to failed condition, and echo failed will only run when the previous command exited with nonzero status
- similarly `if [ 1 != 1 ] || [ 1 = 1 ]` will also run, since in the OR statement means if any of the tests are true, it will do the if loop, even though the first condition is false
`&` single ampersand, the command will run at the same time in the background

### While Loops
```bash
while [ $var -le 10 ]
do
	echo $var
done
```
- same syntax as if statement
- put the commands in `do` and `done`
- the commands will run as long as while condition is true

Example command that keep on trying a command until it succeed
```bash
while [ $? -ne 0 ]
do
    failed command
done
```
**While Loop Shorthand**
```bash
while [ $(docker inspect ombi | jq .[].State.Status | tr -d '"') != "exited" ]; do echo "pls stop ombi"; sleep 0.5; done
```
- separate the `for`, `do` and `done` and additional commands with `;`
### For Loops
```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 "int"
do
	echo $i
done
```
- same concept and syntax as while loop
- will iterate over a [list](1.%20Basic%20Tutorial.md) (`{1..5}`) or (1 2 3 4 5)
There are additional bash functions to create a list ^ffecc6
- eg. `*.py` or `python/python-app-*.py` is a list containing all the python files in a directory, `*` can be used to wildcard match
**Bash Shorthand for For Loops**
```bash
for i in *.txt*; do echo $i; done
```
- same syntax as while loop shorthand

**Breaking Out of a Loop**
The mechanism for breaking/continue is the same as python
```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  if [ $i == 3 ]; then
    break 
  fi
  echo $i # break = 1 2; continue = 1 2 4 5
done
```
`break` - will exit the loop once it hit 3
`continue` - when it's 3, it will be skipped to the next for loop
