Use shebang interpreter
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

**Variable**
```bash
variable="value"
output=$(command)
echo $variable
```
Need to use `$` to reference the variable, it it's empty it will print nothing.
- it's best to create variable in a shell script in lower case since system environment variables are declared in upper case 
`$()` capture the output of a command
- create a command in the background and grab the output
- by default with variable, that variable will be executed as a command
```bash
myvar="echo hello world"
$myvar # hello world will be echoed
```
When declaring a variable in terminal, it will be removed on next login.

**List** 
`1 2 3 4 5` each item is separated by space
`{1..5}` will create a list, similar to python range function, but both numbers are inclusive

### Math
`expr 1 + 1` in bash need to use expr to evaluate a expression
- there need to be space between number and operator
- for multiplication need to use `\*` to escape the asterix
- expr only work with integer argument/variables
Arithmetic operations
`$(( 1 + 1 ))` surround the operation with double bracket and `$`
- `+ - * ** / %` integer operation only
- `()` BEDMAS
`bc` calculator
`echo '1+1' | bc` need to echo to stdout and pipe it into bc
- `+ - * / ^ %` only integer exponent is supported  
- `()` BEDMAS
- `echo 'scale=2; 4/6' | bc` scale determine the number of decimal places, followed by semi-colon
- `bc -l` by default will create many decimal places
- `echo 'sqrt(25)' | bc` only square root possible
