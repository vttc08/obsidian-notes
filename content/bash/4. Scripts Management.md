The scripts can be placed in a location where it's defined as `$PATH` such as `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`
- shell scripts can be renamed without extension (it will run as shell as long as shebang is present)
- now we are able to run this script in anywhere in the system

### Script Scheduling
##### at command
Schedule a command to run at specific time.
```bash
at 12:34 -f myscript.sh
```
- `-f` specify the script file to run
```bash
atq
12      Thu Jun 27 17:00:00 2024 a karis
atrm 12 # the id of the command
```
- `atq` list all the queued commands with a number
- `atrm` followed by the number remove the command
##### [cron](https://crontab.guru/)
- it's good idea for a cron script to use full path of the command `/usr/bin/echo` instead of `echo
```bash
1 2 3 4 5 command_to_run # run on April 3 and all Fridays during April at 2:01 AM
```
- minute, hour, day of month (0-30), month (0-12), day of week (1-7)
- `*` means it will run at all the time
