`echo $?` will tell the exit code of the last command
- exit code of `0` indicate the program is successful
- `$?` will only get exit code of the last command, need to use it before `echo`
`exit` command in a bash script will force exit a program and everything after it will not run

`set -e` will exit the script on error
`set +e` will do the opposite, reset the option of `set -e`

**Data Streams**
`stdout` standard output: output that is printed to the screen that doesn't result in an error
`stderr` standard error: stout that is returning failed. eg. permission denied, file not found
`stdin` standard input: what the user inputs
- `read` command is used to ask user for stdin
```bash
read -p "what's your name: " yourname && echo "Hello $myname"
```
- `-p` option allows for a prompt eg. what's your name
- the stdin is stored in a variable `yourname`

**DS Redirection**
`>` is used to redirect streams
`>>` is for appending streams
`2> /dev/null` will send stderr into dev null, which will hide the stderr message
- `2` is error
- `1` is stdout, not error
- by default `>` only redirect stdout (1), if number not given, 1 is implied
`&> target` will redirect both stdout and stderr to the target
- `&` indicates both 1 and 2
Redirection can be separated
```bash
find /etc -type f 1>stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt
```
- this command will redirect stdout and stderr to different locations separately
