DOM (Document Object Model)
- elements are nested in HTML which creates a tree 
- hierarchy and structure of HTML (like a tree)

**Inline vs Block-Level**
==Inline== tags that wrap around other words, eg. italic, bold, quote
==Block Level== tags that is entire block, eg. blockquote, headings

**HTML File**
Each HTML file must have a `doctype` declaration
```html
<!doctype html>
```
All the HTML content is enclosed in `html` element
```html
<html lang="en-US" dir="ltr"></html>
```
- that element can also have attributes that indicate the language and direction

**head body** (header and body element)
```html
<head></head>
<body></body>
```
The head is about the metadata and won't be displayed on the page.
Body is for the content which will be displayed on page.

**Paragraph**
```html

```
Without marking these, the browser by default renders everything in a single paragraph.

**Headings**
```html
<h1> </h1>
```
The headlines consists of 6 sizes from h1 to h6. Similar to markdown `#`
- h1 is the largest title hence the most important

**Styling**
```html
<i> </i>  <!-- Italic -->
<b> </b> <!-- Bold -->
<u> </u> <!-- Underline -->
<mark></mark> <!-- Highlighted -->
<del></del> <!-- Strikethrough -->
```
- it the closing tag is not used, everything after the starting tag will have the styles applied
- you can also use `<em>` and `<strong>` but sometimes these render the same as `<b>`
