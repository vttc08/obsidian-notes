Gluetun 
https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki
In the download server, stored in `~/docker/warpstack` and in individual folders `megabasterd` and `gluetun`

Docker-compose
```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    container_name: gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    ports:
      - 8888:8888/tcp # HTTP proxy
      - 8388:8388/tcp # Shadowsocks
      - 8388:8388/udp # Shadowsocks
      - 5861:5860
    volumes:
      - ~/docker/gluetun:/gluetun
    env_file:
      - .env # keys
      - wg.env # ip and port
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=custom
      - VPN_TYPE=wireguard
      - WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=172.16.0.2/32
      - FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=10.10.120.0/24
```
Additional configuration such as `NET_ADMIN` and the `/dev/net/tun` are needed.
The ports `5861:5860` is for forwarding ports of other containers
- the port `5861` is the port accessible on the host and bind to `5860` in the container
- the port `5860` is added via other container

The environments are split into 3 parts
- `environments`: non-secret general configurations
- `.env` Wireguard public and private keys which should change
- `wg.env` Wireguard IP address and port information, it is separate to allow easy changing by other programs
`FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS` - this is the subnet for local network outside of Docker, it will be used so the container under VPN will also be able to connect to other computers outside Docker

Adding containers to Wireguard VPN
```yaml
  network_mode: "service:gluetun" # container:gluetun if outside of compose stack
```
Uses special network mode, no port mapping is needed as it won't work. The port has to be set on application level. 
Eg. usually `81:80` is required for other computers to access web port on a container, but when it's under gluetun,. The containers port 80 is mapped to gluetun's port 80 and port forwarding needs to be done via gluetun. If multiple containers runs on port 80 internally, the port must be changed via application settings.

MegaBasterd
```yaml
megabasterd:
    image: vttc08/megabasterd
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    volumes:
      - "~/docker/warpstack/megabasterd:/config:rw"
      - "/mnt/nvme/share/VNC/megabasterd_dl:/output:rw"
    environment:
      - VERSION=8.14
      - KEEP_APP_RUNNING=1
      - WEB_LISTENING_PORT=5860
    env_file: ~/docker/vnc/vnc.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: megabasterd
```
Use the environment `WEB_LISTENING_PORT=5860` to change the port in case multiple jlesage containers are needed behind a VPN, since all jlesage containers runs on port 5800.

ADD SQL OPTIONS LATER
![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020241211225635.png)
Change this in MegaBasterd, by default jlesage apps including this have configuration files located in `/config`, create `reset.sh` with the following content.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
wget --post-data='{"actionId": "reset-megabasterd"}' --header='Content-Type: application/json' http://10.10.120.16:1378/api/StartAction
```
- `10.10.120.16:1378` is the OliveTin server
- uses `wget` instead of `curl` to POST data as it's the default included in jlesage containers
- the OliveTin has action ID of `reset-megabasterd`
- uses OliveTin to execute scripts which restart the entire stack
