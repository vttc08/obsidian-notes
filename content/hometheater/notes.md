Color
8 bit 0-255
Limited 16-235
Bit Depth number of available color shades for each RGB channel to describe a color
- 256 values for 8 bit and 1024 for 10 bits, the available color is then `256^3` for 8-bit
- increasing bit depth reduce banding (increasing color steps)
- in madVR, with dithering, 8bit and 10bit is indistinguishable even with native 10 bit display
Dithering: reduce digital rounding error, maintain information when going from higher to lower bit depth

HDR
larger contrast between brightest and darkest
