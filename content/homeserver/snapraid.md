### [MergerFS](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs)
```shell
sudo apt install fuse mergerfs
```
Create a mountpoint for all the disks.
```shell
mkdir /mnt/disk{1,2,3} # this command will create 3 directory
mkdir /mnt/pool /mnt/parity
```
- edit the disks in `/etc/fstab`
- the disks must have a partition created eg.`/dev/sda1` for the mount
Add mergerfs into `/etc/fstab`
```shell
/mnt/disk* /mnt/storage fuse.mergerfs defaults,cache.files=off,allow_other,category.create=mfs,minfreespace=250G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0
```

Relative path: path in mergerfs pool relative to the path of individual drive and pool
Path preservation: policies that only consider branches (path of individual disks) where the relative path being accessed already exists
- eg. with 3 disks, `/mnt/{a,b,c}`, if a folder `movies` exists in only `a,b` not not `c`, a path preservation policy will only consider `a,b` when a request to create a file `/mnt/pool/movies/file.mkv` and the file would not be created in `c`
- eg. for `epmfs`, the previous example would choose `a,b` and see which drive has most free space and only put files on these drives, even if `c` has more free space; while `mfs` ignore existing path and would create `movies/file.mkv` on `c` if that has the most free space

**MergerFS Options**
- `/mnt/disk*` the disks to be added into mergerfs, assuming the disks are disk1,2,3,4,5
- `/mnt/pool` where the pooled disks are
- `fuse.mergerfs` use mergerfs for this mount
- `defaults`
	- `action=epall` actions such as rename, change metadata (chmod/own) will apply to all found
	- `create=epmfs` files will be created on disks with most free space and preserve path
	- `search=ff` search will act on the first found
- `category.create` the policy 
- `cache.file=off` disable page cache in mergerfs, other options include `partial`, which could be useful for sqlite apps and rtorrent
- `allow_other` is explicitly needed when some of the drives that needs to be pooled are NTFS
- `fsname=mergerfs` shows a friendly name in `df -h` command

###  [SnapRAID](https://www.snapraid.it/manual)
Use Docker to build SnapRAID
https://github.com/ironicbadger/docker-snapraid
- run the `build.sh` and install the package with `sudo dpkg -i *.deb`
SnapRAID is configured via `/etc/snapraid.conf`
```
parity /mnt/parity/snapraid.parity # location of the parity
content /srv/snapraid/snapraid.content # content file
disk d1 /mnt/data # data disk, d1 is the disk name used in snapraid
```
- `content` file contains details of all the files in the array
Example configuration file with exclusions
https://gist.github.com/IronicBadger/ce960d96015b28a03373

`snapraid status` will get the status of array, whether there are corruptions

#### Diff
`snapraid diff` list all the files that are modified from the last sync, it is recommended to run before syncing to check for deleted files
- if a sync is required, it will require `2` as exit code
#### Sync
`snapraid sync` will sync the data and create parity (also compute hashes)
- it's best to use it in a screen/tmux session
- if the SnapRAID sync is abruptly stopped, the next session will start where it's left off
- `-E` will force empty, and sync will proceed even if a data disk is empty
#### Scrub
`snapraid scrub` check the data and parity for errors, it is only read intensive
```shell
snapraid -p 5 -o 20 scrub
```
- `-p` set the % of array to scrub
- `-p bad` will only scrub the bad parts of the array
- `-o` older than, any data older than x days will be scrubbed
#### Fix
`snapraid fix` restore or undeleted files from accident or disk failure
```sh
snapraid fix -f FILE or DIR/ or -m
```
- for directory add `/` to the end
- `-m` option will fix every deleted files
- `-d` will act on entire disk (eg. for recovering), the disk name eg. `d1` is given in the configuration file, it will also fix parity
- `-e` will fix errors in the [scrub](snapraid.md#Scrub) command

#### Check
`snapraid check` verify all files and parity data
- `-a` is audit only, only the file data is checked and parity data is ignored

#### Disaster Recovery
Edit the configuration so that is points to the new disks

```conf
data d2 /mnt/new_location
```
```shell
snapraid -d d2 -l fix.log fix
```
- files that cannot be recovered will have `.unrecoverable` file extension
```shell
snapraid -d d2 -a check
```
- this will only check the data disk that is specified
Lastly run a `snapraid sync`.

#### Automating SnapRAID
https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner
https://github.com/fightforlife/snapraid-runner with apprise support
- `which snapraid` to get the binary file of snapraid, which might be needed for configure the runner
- the python script will run SnapRAID diff command, and only run sync if the deleted is below threshold, optionally can be used to periodically scrub the array
