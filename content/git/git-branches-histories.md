Reset
`git reset 'hash'` reset the head to a previous commit
	- nothing is done to the code yet, unless using `git restore --staged` && `git restore`
	- if accidently reset, use `git reset 'HEAD@{1}'` to revert the progress to the previous git change

### Interactive Rebase
==Rebasing already pushed commit require a forced push.==
```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~3 or <hash>
```
- this will select to up to the third commit from history of commits

The commit message are shown from earliest to latest (different from `git log`)

**Change Commit Message**
use `reword` on the commit
==Do not change the commit message, do so after marking the commit for reword then change it==

**Combine 2 Commits Into 1**

Identify the commits to be merged, then pick the one below it
- if the earliest commit is 4th on the list of commits, choose `HEAD~5`
Using squash on the later commit to combine with the previous one (top one on interactive rebase)
There will be option to choose a new commit message.
The commit hash is changed after rebase.

- squash, take the current commit and combine it with previous commit
- fixup, like squash, combine the commit but not use the commit message

 **Cherry Pick**
```sh
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <hash-of-new-branch>
```
Make sure git is on the current branch (not the new one that contains the commit to be picked)

**Branches**
use `git switch -c` or `git checkout -b`
- now we can work on the features of new branch
Once the feature is done, to merge it with master
```
git switch master
git merge <branch-name>
```
- delete the branch `git branch -d <name>`

**Merge Conflicts**
It can happen when two people are working on the different feature but both are changing the same file causing a conflict.
- in a new branch I added some codes
- then in the main branch I added some conflicting code
- upon `git merge newfeature`, the merge failed due to conflicts

- there is option to accept current, incoming, ignore both or accept combination

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020231217001831.png)
this is an example of accept combination

Stash - quickly save the unstaged changed to a stash to add for later
- `git stash` to create a stash
- `git stash list`
- `git stash apply 0` to apply the stash to the current code

**Reflog**
```sh
git reflog
```
The `reflog` contains list of git histories.
Suppose commits/branches are deleted, it can be restored via `reflog`
- the log will bring up all the actions in a git repo
Pick the commit hash before the mess up and either reset or create a new branch.
```sh
git reset <hash>
git branch new <hash>
```
